 - lcs.c
 	Longest common sub-sequence

 - lis.c
 	Longest increasing sub-sequence

 - lpalin_subsequence.c
 	Longest palindromic subsequence

 - lpalin_substring.c
 	Longest palindromic substring

 - edit_distance.c
	Edit Distance of two strings

 - lcs (longest common sub-sequence) and edit-distance have a lot of similarity
   in between them. The exact same steps have to be followed by the reverse logic
	lcs
		- initialize the '0'the row and column with '0'
		- the char in i and j position are same
			- take from prev diagonal and add 1

		- if i and j are not same
			- take the max from upper and left element

	edit_distance
		initialization
		- in the '0' column the value will be the row index
		and
		- in the '0' rwo the value will be the column index.

		- if the char in i and j position are same
			- copy from prev (upper) diagonal

		- if the char in i and j position are not same
			- take the max of diagonal, upper and left elements and add 1
